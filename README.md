# AMLS_assignment22_23

In this assignment, three machine learning techniques are used to solve two classification tasks. The first task is binary classification, where logistic regression and support vector machine is applied. The experimental results show that logistic regression has a better performance. The second task is multiclass classification, where decision tree and support vector machine are used. Decision tree has a higher accuracy score on the second task based on the results.
